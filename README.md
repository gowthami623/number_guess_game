# number_guess_game

  The project aims to create an interactive guessing game using Python, where players guess a secret number chosen by the computer. 
  To add excitement and engagement, the computer will provide hints to the players as they try to guess the correct number. 
  The game will be designed to offer an enjoyable experience for players of all ages.

## Key Features:

**User-Friendly Interface:**

  The game will have a simple and intuitive interface to ensure ease of use for players.

**Random Number Generation:**

  The computer will generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) that the player must guess.

**User Input Handling:**

  The program will handle user input to receive the player's guesses.

**Hint System:**

  The computer will provide hints to guide the player towards the correct answer. Hints may include whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the secret number.

**Multiple Difficulty Levels:**

  Players will have the option to choose between different difficulty levels, which will determine the range of numbers to guess from and the number of attempts allowed.

**Score Tracking:**

  The game will keep track of the player's score based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

**Play Again Option:**

  After a game ends, players will have the option to play again without restarting the program.

**Error Handling:**

  The program will handle errors gracefully, providing appropriate feedback to the player in case of invalid inputs or other issues.

## Implementation Plan:

**Setting Up the Environment:**

  Install Python on your computer if not already installed. Choose an integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor to write your Python code.

**Coding the Game Logic:**

  Start by writing the core logic of the guessing game. This includes generating a random number, receiving user input, comparing guesses with the secret number, and providing hints.

**Designing the User Interface:**

  Create a user-friendly interface for the game using Python libraries such as Tkinter or Pygame. Design elements such as buttons, text fields, and labels to display information to the player.

**Implementing Difficulty Levels:**

  Incorporate multiple difficulty levels into the game, allowing players to choose their preferred level of challenge.

**Adding Score Tracking:**

  Develop a mechanism to track the player's score based on their performance in each game.

**Testing and Debugging:**
  Thoroughly test the game to ensure it functions as expected. Debug any issues that arise during testing.

**Enhancements and Refinements:**

  Consider adding additional features or refining existing ones to improve the gameplay experience.
